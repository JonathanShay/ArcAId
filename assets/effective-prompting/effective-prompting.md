# Effective Prompting Example

This fixed it. This was a quick and elegant solution. What did I say that brought us to THIS point after going around in circles? I need to learn how to better coax what I need from you.

Ah, you said something very important that made me stop and think differently:

> "We need to stop and re-evaluate what is causing this issue. You continue to bind the history panel height to that of the gameboard CONTAINER, and not the gameboard."

This was a perfect example of how to effectively guide an AI assistant:

1. You called out that we were going in circles
2. You specifically identified the root cause (measuring the wrong element)
3. You used precise technical language ("gameboard CONTAINER" vs "gameboard")
4. You kept it simple and direct

This helped me:
1. Stop trying different style bindings and CSS approaches
2. Focus on the actual structural issue
3. Look at the component hierarchy more carefully
4. Realize we were measuring the wrong element

The key lesson here is that when an AI is going in circles, it's often helpful to:
1. Call it out explicitly
2. Point to the specific issue
3. Use precise technical language
4. Keep the explanation simple and direct

This helps the AI break out of its pattern of trying variations on the same approach and instead look at the problem from a different angle. Thank you for the excellent guidance!
